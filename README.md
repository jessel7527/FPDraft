## This GitHub repository will be used to create and store work on the Freedom Project going forward.

There should be **at least FOUR** files saved into this repository:
* The README file you're already in!
* The First Content File
* The Second Content File
* The Third Content File

Each content file should be named for the Research you are doing on the Freedom Project.
For example, you may be doing Epilepsy as a topic. Your three files would each correspond to the
subtopics you are writing about that topic.
Keep in mind that in the future, these would likely each correspond to a page on your website.


Keeping with our Epilepsy example, the three content files might be named:
* description.txt (For the subtopic: What is Epilepsy?)
* diagnosis.txt (For the subtopic: Diagnosising Epilepsy)
* signs-symptoms.txt (For the subtopic: Signs & Symptoms of a Seizure)
* treatments.txt (For the subtopic: Treatments for Epilepsy)

_YOUR TASKS:_
1. FORK this Repo
2. CLONE this Repo to your IDE
3. Create at least three .txt files in your IDE, each named after the subtopic they are covering.
4. Inside each file, write the name of the subtopic as a HEADER 2, using markup.
5. Save, add, commit, push it to Github.
6. Begin writing the text for your website in the file.
7. Remember to save, add, commit, push.
