## Overview about Zoology

Zoology (also known as animal science) is a field or a branch of a science compartment that encounters with animal's behavior, structure, classification, and distribution of animals. It covers areas ranging from the structure of organisms to the subcellular unit of life. Some zoologist are interested in some aspects of animals while others can be intrigued by their function or their structure.

Zoology is both descriptive and analytical. It can be approached either as a basic science or as an applied science. Historically, the study of zoology can be viewed as a series of efforts to analyze and classify animals. Zoology today is as diverse as the animal kingdom it studies, broadening its range to include such fields as genetics and biochemistry. It now is considered an interdisciplinary field that applies a great variety of techniques to obtain knowledge of the animal kingdom
